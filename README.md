This repository contains the code of our ACM MM 2022 work "Improving Transferability for Domain Adaptive Detection Transformers".

## Getting Started

This work is built on [Deformable DETR](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR) and we borrow a lot of code from its framework (thanks to this great project!).
